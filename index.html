				<h2>Travelling 🗺</h2>
				<p>
					Since I was little I had the opportunity to travel all over the world thanks to my family. These trips have given me the opportunity to enrich myself and to discover a real passion for organizing trips. Indeed, I am particularly attracted by planning a journey in France or abroad. So far, I have planned more than 15 trips for 10 people. To give you an idea, the destinations of these trips were Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Cuba, London, Vienna, Venice or Amsterdam.

				<h2>Cooking 👩🏽‍🍳</h2>
				<p>
					My passion for travelling has given birth to another hobby, which is cooking.I love to cook and enjoy the different culinary cultures that each country has to offer.  Moreover, for me, cooking is a moment of sharing that allows us to reunite around a good dish and enjoy the occasion.

				<h2>Learning 🎆</h2>
				<p>
					The two passions that I have just stated highlight my pleasure in learning and enriching myself through these cultural exchanges. Indeed, when I talk about learning I am talking more about acquiring culture than school learning; I like to broaden my culture and study history more than anything else. 
					Therefore, for me, the people I meet on these trips, visiting historical places or discovering the cuisines of each country can teach me much more than just books.
